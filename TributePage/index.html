        <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and
            political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly
            debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit
            Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia
            University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was
            among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.</p>
        <p>He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London.</p>
        <p>In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer.</p>
        <p>His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for
            partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing
            to the establishment of the state of India.</p>
        <p>In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.</p>
        <p>In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar</p>
        <p>he salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the
            nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".</p>

        <p>In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two
            years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the
            death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.[48] Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the
            construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.</p>
